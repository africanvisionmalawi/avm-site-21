      Ensuring people can get to a health service In our area of support there
      is a huge issue with lack of transport to hospital/clinics. There are not enough
      health centres/hospitals in our area and therefore the catchment area for each
      centre is huge.

      Since 2006 we have completed a number of school building projects including
      a number of school blocks (typically with 6 classrooms) at various locations as
      well as five teachers' houses, kitchens and store rooms. We also build and renovate
      pre-schools.

      What is a CBCC? A CBCC is a building with a multiple use - as a pre-school
      and as a feeding station for children 3-5 years old. Most children in rural areas
      cannot access early learning opportunities through pre-schools and are ill-prepared
      when they start school.

      Distributions will always be a big part of our work, and are vital to
      the orphans who have nothing. We regularly distribute throughout our area clothes,
      toys, sleeping mats, blankets, mosquito nets and food to those most in need in
      the 'hungry months' around February.

      1 in 6 women die in childbirth in Malawi. In April 2010 we filmed in our
      local Clinic and Maternity unit with 8 beds. These serve 13,569 people. There
      was one Medical Assistant and one Midwife to run the two units. The Midwife was
      pregnant.

      Education is free to children up to the end of primary school but if they
      want to go on and get a full education (and hopefully go onto university) it costs
      around £792 for four years at Secondary School This pays for school fees, exam
      fees, school materials, boarding fees, food and school uniform. We are currently
      sponsoring 40 teenagers to go to Secondary school.

      It only costs £150 to build up a well to make it safe a free from contamination.
      This is a great present for your friends and family as it is genuinely saving
      lives and we will have a plaque created with the name of your recipient on it
      to go on the well - we will then take pictures of the well upon completion and
      send it to them.
