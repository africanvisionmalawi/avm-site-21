There are many ways to donate to African Vision Malawi!

## You can make a one-off or regular donation online:

Regular monthly donations are the lifeblood of the charity and allow African Vision Malawi to continue its vital work supporting the orphans and vulnerable people, leading them to a position self-sufficiency. Only £2 a month will ensure that one child receives safe, clean drinking water.

## You can buy a gift for our Malawi friends from our online shop:

Have a browse in the [Shop](/shop/).

## By Post:

If you prefer you can send us a **cheque** to: African Vision Malawi, 31 Upper Brighton Road, Surbiton, Surrey KT6 6QX

Or you may prefer to fill in a **Standing Order** form and post it to us and your bank to give a regular donation.

Do you pay UK tax? If so we can increase your donation by 25% at no extra cost to yourself by claiming Gift Aid. Please fill in the Gift Aid form if so!

\* You can make every gift worth 25% more, if you are a UK taxpayer. Please read the statement below and we'll do the rest. The tax reclaimed will be used to help fund our vital work in Malawi.

"I understand that I must pay an amount of Income Tax and/or Capital Gains Tax for each tax year (6 April one year to 5 April the next) that is at least equal to the amount of tax that all the charities that I donate to will reclaim on my gifts for that tax year. I will tell African Vision Malawi if I am no longer a taxpayer."
