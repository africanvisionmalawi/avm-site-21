## Background Information

The Landirani Trust (the “Trust”) is a small NGO based in Malawi and supported from the UK where the charity is known as African Vision Malawi. Our vision is for a healthy, educated and self-sufficient community in Malawi. We work in an area North West of Lilongwe (near the Airport) that is 400sq km in size, with 14 centres, and around 4,000 OVC beneficiaries (orphan and vulnerable children).

The main activities we deliver are:

- The on-going development of our training village (Sam’s Village) which is primarily being used as an educational site for life-skills and vocational training
- Promoting educational facilities and access to them for all children in the community
- Enhancing the ability of the community to become self-sufficient
- Improving care of orphans and vulnerable people e.g. those affected by extreme poverty, exclusion, HIV/AIDS, disability, etc.
- Providing access to clean, safe water and sanitation

We now have a full-time vacancy for a Monitoring and Evaluation (“M&E”) Officer to work with our small but committed and enthusiastic team.

**Title: M&E Officer**

**Location: Lilongwe, Malawi**

## Primary objectives:

The M&E Officer will be responsible for the measurement, monitoring and evaluation of all projects and programmes undertaken by the Trust. The M&E Officer will ensure that there is consistency in the objectives and success indicators of all projects and will be held accountable for the development and timely delivery of relevant reports against outcomes.

The M&E Officer will be responsible for the overall M&E needs of each project and will come up with findings based on real data to show the performance of each project. This will involve obtaining baseline information from which to measure data. You will need to guide relevant people connected to each project, to provide you with information to support the M&E reports. The M&E Officer will also help the Trust in strengthening its M&E function based on their experience from each project. The M&E Officer will also promote the key lessons for the improvement of each project and for the wider learning of the Trust from ‘lessons learnt’.

The M&E Officer will also be involved with proposal writing, since M&E is a significant part of any proposal.

## Main duties and responsibilities:

- To supervise regular data collection through project managers and project leaders and ensure quality of the data by random verifications and validations
- To record, manage and preserve monitoring and evaluation data in a safe and accessible way
- To analyse and discuss findings based on regular data monitoring
- Provide technical support on M&E and evidence-based recommendations to the relevant project managers and project leaders
- Ensure that the implementation of all field activities adheres to the Trust’s monitoring and evaluation system
- Work closely with the appropriate finance team members and project managers / leaders in the project planning and budgeting process
- Support the Trust in developing regular reports, e.g. quarterly, six monthly and annual reports
