Sanitation, access to clean water and health projects are all closely intertwined.

In 2015, Enactus Sheffield set up a Tapping Potential project in our area. The training they delivered combined borehole maintenance training, soap making and hygiene information.

The group sell the finished soaps to community members and hotels. Limited amounts are also available via our online Store. The profits go to fixing boreholes, fixing water borne problems and the groupâ€™s salaries.
