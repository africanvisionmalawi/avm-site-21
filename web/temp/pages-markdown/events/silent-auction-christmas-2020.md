This Christmas we are holding a Silent Auction. We have been donated some wonderful gifts, some of great value, some as little as £15. Do take the opportunity to look through the items below. There is a guide price below each item which reflects the minimum we expect it to achieve. Bids significantly below this won’t be considered, but those above will! This year we have missed out on £100,000 of funding so please bid generously and help those who are most in need. At this time of year the rains come in Malawi, but people also start to run out of food. Thank you so much for your donation.

If you would like to bid on any item please click on the Bid link above the item and a new email will open for you to tell us your bid. Or, if you prefer just email us at info@africanvision.org.uk quoting the item number you wish to bid on and the amount (or to make an appointment to view!) We will respond straightaway.

The first part of our auction is a selection of hand-made quilts .They were hand-stitched over the last hundred years in America and show minor wear but are in excellent condition.
