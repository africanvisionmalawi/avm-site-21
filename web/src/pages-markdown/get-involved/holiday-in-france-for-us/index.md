## Local recommendations:

‘Chateau du Rivau’
We thoroughly recommend the beautiful Château Du Rivau which our property overlooks. Discover not only a genuine medieval castle at the heart of a UNESCO world heritage site, but contemporary sculptures and a delightful restaurant serving local specialities and produce from the château gardens.The 14 gardens evoke wonderful stories and legends from literature over the centuries.

‘Chinon and Saumur Markets’
The Chinon market on Thursday, the Saumur market on Saturday offer a little bit of everything: clothing stalls and bric-a-brac on one side, live rabbits and chickens on another. Farmers come to sell their homemade goats cheese, hand-picked strawberries and tomatoes; fishmongers offer fresh fish from the Loire and in the fall and winter months, there are wild mushrooms, game and home made wild boar patés.

‘Chinon Red Wine’
Chinon offers some of the best value wines in France. Try Joguet at Sazilly for wines reputed to be as good as many of the best Bordeaux but at a fraction of the price.

‘Chinon Restaurants’
Chinon hosts some of the best restaurants to be found. Even the cheapest offer excellent value for money. The best are simply fabulous!

‘Golf’
The courses selected are all within easy driving distance of Chinon and present different challenges!

Golf de Touraine, Château de la Touche, 37510 Ballan-Miré. Telephone +33 2 47 53 20 28 Email: golf.touraine@wanadoo.fr Golf de Touraine is 6145 yards, Par 71 and is a very friendly golf club. The course is a good test of golf with mature trees and a meandering stream running through it. The chateau clubhouse, overlooking the course has a very good restaurant.

Golf d’Ardree, 6211yards, Par 72, is a modern course set in the parkland of the old chateau with beautiful trees. It also has a very large clubhouse.

Golf de Sept Tours, 6194 yards, Par 72 is a fine parkland course weaving its way through the trees of the estate. It also has a fine chateau surveying the golfers’ progress, while Golf de Loudon, 6981 yards Par 72, is very much in the mold of an army course, with room for the occasional wayward shot.

‘Nearest restaurant’
Many in surrounding area, Chinon especially.

‘Wine Regions’
This area of the Loire offers fantastic variety from the deep reds of Chinon to Vouvray whites from sweet Coteaux du Layon to Anjou Rose – a great week’s wine-tasting!

‘Zoo de Doue’
One of the best zoos in the world, certainly the best we’ve ever seen. Don’t miss it! Wild animals and no cages. The vulture enclosure is a must! [www.zoodoue.fr](https://www.zoodoue.fr)
