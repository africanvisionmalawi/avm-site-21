Our first Training Programme at Sam’s Village took place in May 2017 which was for 98 local based committee members and focused on pro-activity in the community.

From 2018 we will offer residential courses primarily for vulnerable adults in our local area. Through these courses we hope to help the people of rural Malawi to help themselves in a sustainable way.

Sam’s Village will offer courses on Carpentry, Tailoring and Basic Electronics. The accredited training will be delivered by the Technical, Entrepreneurial and Vocational Education and Training Authority (TEVETA) and is being organised in conjunction with the local communities.

For more information please email us.

£10 can help the trainees set up in business after their training.
