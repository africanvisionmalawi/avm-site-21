  - linkTitle: Groundnut Farming

      a sustainable way of making a real difference to people's lives.

  - linkTitle: Fuel-Saving Stoves
    linkText:
      Fuel-saving stoves use less wood, preventing deforestation and saving
      money. They are also safer - children and epileptic people are less likely to
      fall into the fire and suffer severe burns.

  - linkTitle: Reforestation
    linkText:
      Wood is the main source of fuel for keeping warm and cooking. Our Reforestation
      Project is promoting self-sufficiency within our support area.

  - linkTitle: Food Mill
    linkText:
      We are building a Food Mill at Kafutwe. This mill will help the local
      people to maintain a sustainable income. Millet, sorghum and legumes can be ground
      at the mill, as well as maize.

  - linkTitle: Vegetable Gardens
    linkText:
      We are aiming to attach a vegetable garden to each school in our area
      which will be maintained by the children and teachers and provide much needed
      food to the orphans and children in the schools.

    linkText:
      Hundreds of trees were planted back in 2008 and the trees in Chitsime,
      Masiye and M'bang'ombe are thriving, despite droughts.
