This project helps to ensure that people can get to a health service. In our area of support there is a huge issue with lack of transport to hospital/clinics.

There are two small Health Centres in our area and they serve a catchment area of 45,000 people!

Because of the lack of health services in our area people have to travel vast distances to be seen by a nurse or doctor. Travel to the clinics is usually by ox and cart but this is an expensive and slow mode of transport. 1 in 6 women die in childbirth, these bicycle ambulances will help save many lives.

We initiated a project to build bicycle ambulances and to provide training to the people in each area so more people can make their way to a health centre.
