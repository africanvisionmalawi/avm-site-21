Bokela’s job is Site Support at Sam’s Village, and he is our master thatcher.  Here is his story at African Vision Malawi (aka Landirani):

## Bokela Gunda – My Life Story

My life story is as follows:

I was just staying at home farming. After that I was employed by Landirani on 14th November as a security guard. When I was at that position I was supporting the village for planting fruit trees e.g. Mango, and Orange trees.  Around the village Mango trees are now producing fruits.

From 2012 December I was promoted as an agriculture officer. When I was at that position my site manager tried to teach me a new skill of thatching – now I am a thatcher master here at the village. Here I thatched many houses e.g. Compost toilet, site manager’s house, Library, Mteza workshop, trainee accommodation, reception and the volunteer accommodation and I am still going on with this skill.  Now I have worked in Landirani for 5 years during the period of my skills of thatching.  Many people call me from town to do some work in weekends and now I am very proud of my skills of thatching.

Landirani helps me to support my family with money to pay school fees for my children and many things in my life so far. I think without Landirani in my life I would be in so many problems.

My message to Landirani supporters is that I will work hard in order to improve the development of Landirani here at Sam’s Village project which Landirani wants to do here, and where Landirani has any project I will be able to go and work.

Lastly, I give more support to Landirani for giving more support to the areas where Landirani helps many people around.
