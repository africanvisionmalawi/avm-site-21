We have received a truly generous offer of £40,000 of matched funding which will allow us to complete the remaining accommodation blocks and train 100 people next year. To receive this amount we need to receive donations to the same value. We have already received £17,000 towards this, so need to raise a further £23,000. This is really life-changing work which will transform some of the world's poorest people, giving them jobs and self-sufficiency.
