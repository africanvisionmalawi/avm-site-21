On the 15 JUNE 2019 we are once again holding our fantastic INDULGENCE DAY at 31 Upper Brighton Rd, Surbiton where therapists will be coming to donate their time and skill to help AVM raise some much needed funds for the orphan & vulnerable in our area in Malawi. Thereâ€™ll also be some stalls, a beer tent, lunches & tea & cake. For more details, including how to book a treatment, please [click here](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/africa-vision-news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/INDULGENCE-DAY-2019.pdf) or on the poster.
