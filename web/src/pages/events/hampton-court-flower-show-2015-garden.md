> The Malawi Garden presented a powerful message as African Vision Malawi strives to promote the practice of sustainable planting to build resilient communities and combat famine. An infinity mirror at the garden’s centre creates the appearance of fields of maize stretching into the distance; the nature of the illusion forces the observer to question whether food security can be achieved by relying on a single crop. Alternatives to this are shown in the key planting areas surrounding the illusion. The ‘Three Sisters Bed’ contains three crops that benefit each other: maize provides a structure for beans to climb, the beans fix nitrogen into the soil, and the squash spreads along the ground, helping prevent weeds and creating a microclimate that helps retain moisture in the soil. The ‘Key hole gardens’ are particularly efficient in hot climates as they hold moisture and nutrients due to an active compost pile placed in the centre of a round bed. The raised beds are built from sustainable earth building methods. The ‘Wild garden’ displays traditional medicinal plants and beneficial flowers, showing Malawi’s great diversity.
