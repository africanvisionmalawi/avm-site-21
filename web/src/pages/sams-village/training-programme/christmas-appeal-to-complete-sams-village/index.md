We are delighted to announce that a ‘Champion’ has come forward to support our Christmas appeal. Earlier this year we sought and found ‘pledgers’ who offered to match-fund donations of up to £8000. So if you donated £5, another £5 would be added to this, from the ‘pot’ of £8000. What is really exciting is that our Champion will further double this once again. So if you were to pledge £5 this would be quadrupled to £20. If you could pledge £5 a month, over the year the contributions we would receive with Gift Aid would actually reach £300!!

Our Christmas Appeal this year is to raise the final £32,000 needed to complete Sam’s Village. This ambitious project started 5 years ago and the final stages of construction are almost complete. We have raised funds for this but now need to fit out the Village with accommodation for the trainees, solar energy, benches and training materials for the workshop and many interior fittings to make the Village complete. Next year the training can then get started with courses scheduled in Tailoring, Carpentry, Early Years development, Life Skills and many more.
