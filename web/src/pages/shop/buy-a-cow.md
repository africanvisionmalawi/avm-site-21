We are going to be building a [biogas digester](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/sams-village/biogas/) at Sam’s Village, which will collect methane gas from cow manure to produce gas for us to cook on sustainably at our Training Village Restaurant. Buy a cow, or more than one, to be a part of our new herd.

If you need to buy a special birthday present for someone, this is the perfect original gift! You will receive a gift card too.

This is part of our project to create a truly sustainable Training Village at [Sam’s Village](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/sams-village/), and like all our projects, supports orphans and vulnerable people in our focus area.

You can also buy a [share in a biogas cow](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/product/buy-a-biogas-cow-share/) for £50!

Thank you for your support!
