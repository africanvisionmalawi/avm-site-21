It only costs £360/year (£30/month) to sponsor a child through secondary school

Education is free to children up to the end of primary school but if they want to go on and get a full education (and hopefully go onto university) it costs £1440 for four years at Secondary School. This pays for school fees, exam fees, school materials, boarding fees, food and school uniform.

We are typically sponsoring 40 teenagers to go to Secondary School. We are delighted that many of our previous sponsored students have completed school successfully, and some have gone on to university education.

We are looking for more sponsors for the next school year – is that person you? Please help give a child a chance of education and a way out of poverty.

## An example of a Student Profile – Lonely Zefenia Banda:

![lonely](/img/projects/4acb49fa8e77flonely_banda_2.jpg)

Hello. My name is Lonely Zefenia Banda. I am 14 years old and was born on the 12th May 1994. I am in form 1B at Lilongwe Girls’ Secondary School. I started here in January, and I am really enjoying my time here.

I come from the Chimbalu area and went to Chimbalu Full Primary School. I have one brother who is 9 years old and 2 sisters one aged 12 who also goes to Chimbalu School and is in Standard 5, and one aged 17 who is married.

My favourite subjects at secondary school are English Mathematics, Bible Knowledge and Geography. When I finish at this school I want to go to University to train to be a nurse.

When I am not studying I enjoy playing football, watching films, reading books and writing folk tales.

I want to tell you that I am very happy that you pay my schools fees.

God bless you and thank you very much. If you did not help me I would not be able to go to secondary school.

I will do my very best in my studies.
