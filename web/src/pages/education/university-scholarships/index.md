African Vision Malawi currently supports 20 university scholarship students including those at the University of Malawi, the Polytechnic, the Kamuzu College of Nursing and at Chancellor College. We support some student for both their study costs and their living costs.  Others receive government loans for their study costs and we help with their living costs, like transport, stationary and lodging.

## Life Stories:

Our University Students are writing their life stories down for us, so that our supporters can better understand the challenges they have faced trying to get an education in rural Malawi.

Evelyn Dongolosi is a third student at Kamuzu College of Nursing. Like the others, she is from humble beginnings and is now bearing fruit after hard work through their Secondary Scholarships. The stories of these girls show the amazing transformation that education can bring. Thanks to the generosity of their sponsors, who had faith and supported them, these young women are the future of health provision in Malawi.

Come back soon to read more stories from our other sponsored University students.  In addition to Nursing, they study Accountancy, Languages and more.
