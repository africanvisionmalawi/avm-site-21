## What can YOU do?

Some ideas to get you thinking:

A sponsored bike ride, walk, run, climb or swim

A marathon or triathlon

A gig or concert

A collection at your church

A cake stall

A sponsored silence

and many more from the internet [here](https://www.gapyear.com/articles/90420/a-to-z-of-fundraising-ideas)

Maybe you’d like to run an activity for kids to raise money, or maybe your child would like to ask friends to donate to African Vision Malawi – perhaps to buy uniforms or books for our young friends in Malawi – instead of receiving presents for his or her birthday?

Get in touch with us at [info@africanvision.org.uk](mailto:info@africanvision.org.uk) for a fundraising welcome pack!

## Resources

We find Crowdfunder is good for creating your own event and you can set up your page [here ...](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/apf/step/basics/7nPGOrqW)

We have prepared a sponsorship form template for collecting donations offline.

We can help you promote your event, through our social media channels.

We have good links with the cornerHOUSE in Surbiton if you need a venue.

Your support will make a direct difference to the lives of orphans and vulnerable people in rural Malawi – some of the poorest people in the world. Thank you for making a difference.
