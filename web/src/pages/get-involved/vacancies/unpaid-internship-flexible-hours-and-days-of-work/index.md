African Vision Malawi is a non-profit organisation that was set up in 2005 to support orphans and vulnerable people in a rural part of Malawi, Africa. Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. We are an organisation going from strength to strength and making a big impact in making our vision come true. The vision of ‘a healthy, educated, self-sufficient community in Malawi’ and ‘creating lasting change’. Most of the support is through Education, as we feel this is a way out of poverty. We look at a holistic approach of supporting in all areas of health, education and self-sufficiency. We are helping to go back to the natural solutions to ‘food security’ through permaculture techniques, health solutions through natural medicinal remedies and providing clean water solutions.

Our exciting new project is Sam’s Village which will help provide vocational and life skills training to help them on that road to self-sufficiency. Do you want to be part of that journey of making a difference?

We are looking for an enthusiastic person, who feels they are a great organiser, creative, pro-active, independent thinker, who wants to make a difference to a developing community. We have a small team of volunteers in our Surbiton office and we’re currently looking for additional support. The job could involve a variety of activities depending on your strengths and interests including fund raising, research, events management, public relations, IT, finance, social media, etc. There is also flexibility for you to work from home, if applicable.

All our roles in the UK are unpaid so that we can maximise the amount of funds we direct to our projects in Malawi. However, we will pay for your transport and provide a lunch. If you think you would like to apply for this volunteer internship role, please send a c.v. to [heather.palmer@africanvision.org.uk](mailto:heather.palmer@africanvision.org.uk) so we can arrange a time to meet up for a chat.

Tel: 020 8287 8169

We are a 10 minute walk from Surbiton Station, and not far from 71, K1 and 465 bus stops
