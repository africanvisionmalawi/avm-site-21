      helps people in our community with impaired mobility of all kinds to get
      moving, as well and as independently as possible, by helping them to get access
      to prostheses and orthoses. When people are born with deformities, lose their
      limbs or the use of their limbs due to accident, disease or poverty, many of them
      also lose their livelihoods, homes or families.

      Many thanks to Bryanston School for raising funds to build a Safe Motherhood
      Unit in Malawi throughout 2020/21 to create a safe and comfortable place for mothers
      and their new-born babies. This will provide essential care for pre-term births
      - which are higher in Malawi than anywhere else in the world. The project will
      include nutritional permaculture gardens in front of the new wing, and education
      on good nutrition for new mothers.
